An AI example written in python to show a unicorn how to train a CNN ' Convolutional Neural Network' to predict whether 'it' is happy or sad based on 'its' facial expressions using a supervised learning model/algorithm. it's been set up for you to train it with your face as a fun practice.

You train it by either moving pictures into their specified folders, or use the webcam image capture codes where they'll capture your image and save it in its defined folder based on which code you're using. each capture code is labeled with its associate folder. They're all tiny codes in which you can see their behaviour before running them.

Saved_model folder contains the weights which the neural network hold after being trained. SO you can use it in the future, BUT, the code to load a saved model to test an image using it isn't available here, it's your task to play and figure it out. it's a pretty simple tiny excerise hehe.

Python is really easy to figure and play with it so don't let that hold you. You're capable, you're tough , you're smart and most of all you have a clean brain to process it all.
