An AI example written in python to show a unicorn how to train a CNN ' Convolutional Neural Network' 
to detect and differentiate between images using a supervised learning model/algorithm. it's been set up for you to train it with your face as a fun practice.

You train it by either moving pictures into their specified folders, or use the webcam image capture codes where they'll capture your image and save it in its defined folder based on which code you're using. each capture code is labeled with its associate folder.
